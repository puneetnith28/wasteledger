 WasteLedger – Empowering Communities for a Cleaner Future
🏆 About the Project
WasteLedger is a platform designed to connect individuals, especially the youth, with dedicated cleanliness drive communities and NGOs. Our mission is to foster habitual waste disposal practices by introducing a streak-based system that encourages users to actively participate in keeping their surroundings clean.
Users can upload daily photos of responsible waste disposal to maintain their streak, and those who successfully complete a 10-15 day challenge receive a certificate of appreciation from an associated NGO or community.
